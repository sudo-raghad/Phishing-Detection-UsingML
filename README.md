Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning - Deep Learning Neural Networks

Overview

This project aims to develop a robust phishing detection system using machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning neural networks. Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by tricking users into disclosing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. By leveraging a dataset of websites categorized as phishing or legitimate, this project employs deep learning models to automatically classify websites as either phishing or legitimate, thus enhancing cybersecurity measures and protecting users from potential threats.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of features extracted from websites, including URL length, presence of HTTPS, domain age, and various other indicators commonly associated with phishing attacks. Each website in the dataset is labeled as either phishing or legitimate, providing supervised learning data for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets.

- Model Development: Deep learning neural networks, particularly multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), are implemented using Python libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These models are trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn patterns and features indicative of phishing websites.

- Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing dataset. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning may be employed to optimize model performance.

- Deployment: Once trained and evaluated, the best-performing model is deployed as a phishing detection system. This system can be integrated into web browsers, email clients, or network security solutions to automatically detect and flag potential phishing attempts in real-time.

Code Implementation

The project code is written in Python, leveraging popular machine learning and deep learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. The code is organized into modules for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. Additionally, Jupyter Notebooks may be provided to facilitate interactive exploration of the code and analysis results.

Conclusion
This work contributes to enhancing cybersecurity by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate phishing attacks. By developing and deploying an accurate and efficient phishing detection system, this project aims to safeguard users' online security and privacy in an increasingly digital world.
